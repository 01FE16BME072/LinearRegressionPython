# LinearRegressionPython
As a part of my learning of machine learning course i wanted to implement Linear Regression so i wrote the code for that
The code uses Both Gradient descent and OrdinaryLeastSquare fit method written from scratch and also i have used scikit learn and tensorflow to do the same
As a part of this i wrote everything in a differnt file so that it will be helpfull to you guys and also given you the dataset which i have used
